# Create member management store
touch src/stores/memberManagementStore.ts
```

**Store Structure:**

- Member data management
- Membership types data
- Member activity tracking
- Member analytics data
- Member communication state
- Member verification state

### Step 2: Create Member Management Components

```bash
# Create member management components
mkdir -p src/components/admin/member
touch src/components/admin/member/MemberManagement.tsx
touch src/components/admin/member/MemberList.tsx
touch src/components/admin/member/MemberForm.tsx
touch src/components/admin/member/MemberProfile.tsx
```

**Component Structure:**

- `MemberManagement` - Main member management interface
- `MemberList` - Member list dengan filtering
- `MemberForm` - Member registration/edit form
- `MemberProfile` - Member profile view

### Step 3: Setup Membership Types

```bash
# Create membership type components
mkdir -p src/components/admin/membership
touch src/components/admin/membership/MembershipTypes.tsx
